  header: 'About the ''<span class="text-indigo-600">''Brain-Up''</span>'''
  intro:
    A team of volunteers started to develop the Brain-Up interactive audio exercise platform for people with cognitive speech problems.
    The ability to hear and to understand speech can be significantly improved thanks to these special and regular activities. Welcome!
  context:
    header: Background information
    text:
      0:
        According to statistics, almost 10% of people have hearing problems of different origins. However, about 20-30% of people can significantly
        improve the ability to hear with the help of special exercises. The analysis of electrical impulses, which transform sound signals into words
        and speech, occurs in separate areas of the brain. The recent data showed that the brain does not stop developing over the years and lends
        itself to training at almost any age.
      1:
        American specialists began to study the mentioned topic above about 20 years ago. As a result, they have accumulated good experience and
        analytics. Worked with engineers, they have developed several programs with exercises that genuinely  work and help many people to restore
        their listening skills. Unfortunately all of these apps are quite expensive. Furthermore, they not adapted for non-English speaking populations.
        In addition, they do not plan to support multilingual language blocks in the near future. One can see the obvious necessity of analogues of
        apps for Russian-speaking people.
      2:
        This project is being developed jointly with leading experts in the field of defectology in order to create a similar analogue
        of apps thanks to public scientific developments in this area. The project is not commercial. Volunteers take part in the development of this
        project. We are open to any help and cooperation.
      3:
        In the history of this draft more than 40 people have taken part in the development of apps from different countries (Russia, Ukraine,
        Belarus, Poland, Netherlands, Mexico) since 2019.
      4: The working version of the Brain-Up program is already ready, where one can register and practice right now."

    header: Training plan and exercise program
    us_recomendations:
      title: 'Lesson recommendations given by American colleagues:'
      0: it is necessary to exercise regularly (at least 6 times a week 30 minutes a day)
      1: it is necessary to listen to audio material, heed and complete tasks
      2: if you feel that the task is not very easy for you, do it again and again
      3: the aim is not the number of correct answers, but the duration of lessons on the development of auditory perception
    description:
      exercise_groups: The block of classes consists of two groups of exercises - non-speech and speech exercises.
      non_speech_group: The non-speech block is still in development, but there are already several exercises.
      speech_group:
        "There are several series of the same type in the speech block: Words, Group of words, Phrases. They have already been practically completed
        technically. Series will soon be supplemented with exercises. It is already possible to study these series."
    series:
      0:
        "The \"Words\" series is the first one to start with. This series is aimed to help the user to train the ability to hear words spoken in
        silence and words with the imposition of various noises (more difficult version)."
      1:
        "The matrix form of the exercises of the \"Group of words\" series was created by Inna Vasilievna Koroleva, professor of the Department
        of Hearing and Speech, LORNII. This successful methodology has already proven itself for many years. The user sees the matrix and hears
        words from each column in random order. As a result, there is a grammatically correct sentence with no meaning. The goal is for the
        brain to concentrate on the words, and not guess the meaning. For example, the following sentences can be generated: \"A girl reads
        cherries\", \"Grandmother draws books\", \"A woman dances money\", \"A girl draws money\", etc."
      2:
        "A series of \"Phrases\" teaches the user to focus on such difficulties as endings, prepositions and the particle \"not\" in a sentence."
